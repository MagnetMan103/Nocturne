# Nocturne

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

This app was created for the Big Red Hacks 2024 Hackathon. 
It lets users pick a mood and type their feelings to generate a song that adapts
to their emotions.

It won 2nd place for the overall Hackathon of best fitting the theme of Lifestyle.
We all got nice pairs of beats headphones as our prize.

Shout out to the Big Red Hacks team for putting together the event.
